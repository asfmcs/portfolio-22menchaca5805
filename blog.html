<p id=day-1> When I first expirienced HTML, I had no idea of how big programming is. I thought that you could have basic blocks, and from that you base ourself on how to build a website. I had done a few programs before and I thought that it was easy. But when CSS came, I was surprised on how big the programs were, by the color, shape, and style. <br><br>You could see how tideous and stressing is to write HTML code so that a website looks modern, sleek, and pretty. I had been lost sometimes, but then you could find the answer of that certian tag or line of code so that what you wanted to put. So it had a simple awnser to a simple problem. Or then you have a little bug that you don't see, and when you find it, it's like charging your phone when it's 1%  </p>


<p id=day-2> When I started to write more code, it became easier. However, I found out about lists, they were really hard, you had to see a table to see which tag corresponded to the part of the table the "<-tbody-><-/tbody->" and the mostrosotiy that was to write a simple table. To remember the tags for a table was pretty surprising.<br> <br> Css becomes more acoustumed after you do it for a while, and HTML is like muscle memory. I don't know how the future looks for HTML/CSS but it looks really big, like really big. I could think of the future, where we have 3d monitors. Where you could leiterlaly see the entire webpage in a box, in where it's harder to program. </p>
