It's a country of legends, of beauties that come from the eras of the Neolithic's, to the clasic and often civilized eras of the barouqe time period, even being a key fighter in the seige of malta in june 1940 against the frroucious Nazi empire.

  <p>Malta is also known for it's traditions. Rural Malta belive in superstitions regarding fertility, menstruation and pregnancy, including the avoidance of cemeteries during the months leading up to childbirth, and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses. Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their cravings for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark. On a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as il-quċċija, where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, crucifix or rosary beads, a book, and so on. Whichever object the child shows most interest in is said to reveal the child's path and fortunes in adulthood. This will define the childs life for the future and beyond. As you can see, Malta is a country of traditions, of history, and kkeping that part of Maltese Culture alive. </p> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRTQ2gNlGSm7PlcR7Q_qzu9nO1T1XIme8PzJ-x3ha2MTnHtwzYFHQ
